## Program structure

Contrary to Go official guidelines, I'm including the entire workspace under version control, 
rather than `src/*` directory (officially called *repositories*). It was simply easier to do this, 

## Running the program

From the project root directory, run the following commands:

```
. .env
go run server
```
